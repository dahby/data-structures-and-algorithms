## Breadth First Traversal

Write a function called breadthFirstTraversal which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach and print every visited nodeâ€™s value.

## Challenge

Finding a way to utilize a data structure to hold the nodes while moving through the tree was by far the most difficult part.
