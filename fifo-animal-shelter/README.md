## FIFO ANIMAL SHELTER

Create a class called AnimalShelter which only takes in cats & dogs. AnimalShelter works in a FIFO approach. 

### Challenge

Write two methods, `enqueue(animal)` & `dequeue(pref)`. `enqueue` adds either a dog or cat to AnimalShelter. `dequeue` returns the longers waiting dog, cat, or either depending on the `pref` value.
